    <h1>No man is an Island</h1>

    <P>
No man is an island entire of itself;<br> every man 
is a piece of the continent,<br> a part of the main; 
if a clod be washed away by the sea,<br> Europe 
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine 
own were;<br> any man's death diminishes me, 
because I am involved in mankind.<br>
And therefore never send to know for whom 
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. 
   </P>
