<h1> No man is an island </h>
<h2> the peom </h2> <br>

</p>No man is an island, <br>

Entire of itself, <br>

Every man is a piece of the continent, <br>

A part of the main. <br>

If a clod be washed away by the sea, <br>

Europe is the less. <br>

As well as if a promontory were. <br>

As well as if a manor of thy friend’s <br>

Or of thine own were: <br>

Any man’s death diminishes me, <br>

Because I am involved in mankind, <br>

And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; <br>

It tolls for thee. <br>

</p>
