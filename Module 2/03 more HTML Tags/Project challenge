Parboil for about ten minutes, then add water and cook till the meat is tender and the stock (water) is about to dry. Use two seasoning cubes, a teaspoon of salt and a half cup of sliced onions.</li>

<li>Pour hot water over the stockfish in a bowl and wash thoroughly to remove sand, then set aside. Also remove center bone from the roasted fishes, wash and set aside too.</li>
<li>Set your cooking pot on the fire and add 300ml of palm oil (red oil), allow to heat for a minute but don’t allow to bleach.</li>
<li> Add the egusi paste and keep stirring for the next eight to ten minutes to form seed-like crumbs.</li>
<li>Then transfer the already cooked meat into the pot, stir.</li>
<li>Add the washed dry fish, stockfish, ground crayfish, a seasoning cube, ground scotch bonnet pepper and 6 cups of water.</li>
<li> then cover half way and allow to boil for the next ten minutes.</li>
