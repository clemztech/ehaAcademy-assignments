        <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>
        
        <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
        <p id="ohnoes-says"></p>
        
        <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
        <p id="winston-says"></p>
        <script>
            var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
            ohnoesSays.innerHTML = "I hate seeing people < strong> suffering </strong>. I hate <strong> poverty </strong> with passion. someday I will definately be <em> rich like Dangotte </em>!";
            var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");
            var winstonSays.textCONTENT = "THAT GUY HAS A GREAT MIND WITH A VISION!"
        </script>
